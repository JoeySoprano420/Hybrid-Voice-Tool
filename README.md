### ðŸ”® **Overview:**

**VoxMyst** is a cutting-edge JUCE-based audio plugin that merges **Voice Modulation**, **Pitch Correction**, and a **Multi-Band Vocoder Engine** into one elegant, versatile instrument. Built for producers, vocalists, sound designers, and experimentalists, VoxMyst allows you to completely **remodel vocal timbres**, **revoice performances**, and **generate synthetic textures** from organic sources or MIDI-controlled carriers.

Compatible as a **VST3, AU, and Standalone Application**, VoxMyst goes beyond traditional vocoding by integrating:

- Real-time **pitch stabilization** and correction
- Synth-based **carrier waveform selection** (sine, saw, noise)
- **MIDI routing** for performance-based vocoding
- A fully interactive **formant matrix editor** with click-and-drag control
- **Animated vocoder band visualizations**
- File-based **preset saving/loading** for instant recall
- Expandable architecture for future synthesis, FX, and AI-assisted vocal designs
